The Academy began functioning with 65 Founding Fellows and the formal inauguration took place at the Indian Institute of Science.</p>
                            <p class="gap-below">On the same afternoon its first general meeting of Fellows was held during which Sir C V Raman was elected President and the draft resolution of the Academy was adopted.</p>
                            <p class="gap-below">In the same month of 1934, the first issue of the Academy’s earliest publication was published. The Academy from its very beginnings has taken great interest and initiative in publishing science research and today publishes 10 science journals in different disciplines, uses an online submission and review management system that’s trackable, papers are peer reviewed and published content is made available online and open access.</p>
                            <p class="gap-below">The Academy’s contribution to science and society is also reflected through its policies, values and its range of activities which include:</p>

Indeed the first issue of the Academy’s earliest publication titled ‘Academy Proceedings’, a monthly, appeared in July 1934, the very month that the Academy was formally founded. Publication of science journals has since remained an important activity. Today the Academy publishes 10 science journals in various disciplines. Starting 2007, the Academy journals are being co-published with Springer. <a href="<?=BASE_URL?>Journals/Overview/" class="moretag" title="read more">More</a></p>
