                    The Centre is named after Dhvanyaloka, the title of a critical work of the 9th century A.D. by Anandavardhana representing the highest peak of Indian genius in critical response to works of art. “Dhvani” literally means sound, but, rightly, for Ananda K.Coomaraswamy, it is sounding which means one continues to hear the reverberations of what one has read, seen or heard in the deep heart’s silence. Anandavardhana’s work sheds light on all this in Art Experience. The Centre is dedicated to the renewal of this rich potential in our approach to work of art. Svalpam Apyasya Dharmasya…!
