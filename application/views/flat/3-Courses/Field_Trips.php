    <h1>Field Trips</h1>
    <h2>Program Details</h2>

    <img src="<?=STOCK_IMAGE_URL?>fieldtrips.jpg" class="img-responsive banner">
    <p>Two major fieldtrips and several smaller trips are included in the academic program as an invaluable opportunity to see Indian cultural and historical sites firsthand. Students visit places they learn about in the classroom.</p>
    <p>The first trip includes a visit to the Gomateshara statue, one of the oldest and most important Jain pilgrimage centers in India, and two Hoysala temples at Halebid and Belur.</p>
    <p>The second, longer field trip covers the rock-cut architecture of Badami, Pattadakal and Aihole, both developing grounds for South Indian temple architecture; the Islamic architecture of Bijapur and the impressive ruins of the medieval Hindu empire of Vijayanagar at Hampi.</p>
    <p>Time for travel is built into the program so that students are able to explore India on their own.  Three-day weekends allow for travel to places around Mysore and the rest of South India.</p>
    <p>Longer vacations include a two-week break for the Dasara festival in October and a few days off for the Diwali holidays a few weeks later.  (The former is a lengthy religious festival, for which Mysore is famous and the latter a family holiday in some respects similar to Christmas).  During these vacation periods students may travel to other parts of India.  Commonly students travel north to places such as Rajasthan and Agra, home of the Taj Mahal.  Others prefer to explore South India, visiting the backwaters of Kerala, for example, or staying in an ashram at Pondicherry.</p>
